 1. Introduction to Python Programming.
 2. Familiarization of  basic Python Libraries such as Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas and
 Matplotlib.*
 3. Write a Python program to find the union and intersection of two lists.
 4. Design a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given  sentence.
 5. Write a Python program to multiply two matrices.*
 6. Write a Python program to find the most frequent words in a text  file.*
 7. Implement and demonstrate  Single, Multi variable and Polynomial Regression for a
 given set of training data stored in a .CSV file and evaluate the accuracy.*
 8. Implement a Python program to perform logistic regression on a dataset.
 9. Write a Python program to implement  Naive Bayes classifier and calculate the
 accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set.*
 10. Write a Python program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3
 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this
 knowledge to classify a new sample.*
 11. Assuming a set of data that need to be classified, use a Support Vector Machine
 classifier to perform this task and evaluate the accuracy.*
 12. Implement K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify any dataset.
 13. Implement K-Means Clustering using any given dataset.*
 14. Build an Artificial Neural Network using Backpropagation algorithm and test the same
 with appropriate dataset.*
 15. Implement dimensionality reduction using PCA
